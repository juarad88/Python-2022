After returning after defeating the dreadful beast in the Cave Of Sorrows, you hear of a wicked wizard in Alastair and decide to investigate. Upon your arrival,  you discover a red-clad wizard.

With broadsword in hand, racing up to the wizard, as your blade slices through him, a plume of crimson smoke clouds your vision , leaving you unconscious.")
